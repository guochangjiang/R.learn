# Editors

We need editors mainly because of LaTeX. For markdown, a simple text editor is often enough.

An editor often can integrate many steps into one command/click.

## RStudio

Official support to Sweave and **knitr**.

cool features on error navigation and PDF/Rnw sync

## LyX

unbeatable LaTeX front-end

## Texmaker

has simple support for Sweave; also can define custom user commands

## Eclipse

do not know much about it yet

## WinEdt

proprietary software; have not used it for a few years since I came to Ubuntu, but is configurable too
