# Document Formats

We have a few document formats, but the big picture is more or less the same. We need to read an input, parse it, execute the code, and write the output.

## Input Syntax

patterns: regular expressions to identify code blocks and other elements

- markdown
- LaTeX
- HTML

## Output Renderers

output hooks: how to wrap up output
